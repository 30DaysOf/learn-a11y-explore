# Learn a11y

A web app for learning web accessibility.

This is meant to accompany my Introduction to Accessibility workshop but my hope is that it will stand fine on its own.

> Requires some type of http server. I recommend node's http-server package.

## Installation

### Node

```
npm install -g http-server
git clone https://github.com/jkup/learn-a11y.git
cd learn-a11y
http-server
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8080

### Python

Download and unzip https://github.com/jkup/learn-a11y/archive/master.zip
```
cd learn-a11y
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8000
